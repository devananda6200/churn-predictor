## Customer Churn Prediction

Customer attrition or churn, is when customers stop doing business with a company. It can have a significant impact on a company's revenue and it's crucial for businesses to find out
the reasons why customers are leaving and take steps to reduce the number of customers leaving. One way to do this is by identifying customer features that are at risk of making them leave such as Phone service(in case 
of a telecom company), previous accusations, rumours, bad service etc. and implementing retention strategies to keep them. Also, by using data and machine learning techniques, companies can predict which customers are likely
to leave in the future and take actions to keep them before they decide to leave.
